## Introduction

As the project

### Requirements

### Let's kick off!

First of all we should generate a PGP key pair just for our team/app/deployment.

Note: Use "gpg --full-generate-key" for a full featured key generation dialog.

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: SOPS Encryption Key
Email address: foo@bar.com
You selected this USER-ID:
    "SOPS Encryption Key <foo@bar.com>"

Change (N)ame, (E)mail, or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
